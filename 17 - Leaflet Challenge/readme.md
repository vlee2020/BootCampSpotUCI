## Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Objective:
- Visualize an earthquake data set
- Use the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize
- Use the URL of that decision to import in data for this visualization
- Create data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
