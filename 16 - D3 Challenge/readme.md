Main Objective:
- Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables from the data.csv file using D3
- Include state abbreviations in the circles
- Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart
- Leverage LiveServer or python -m http.server to run the visualization locally
- Create a tooltip that is activated when you click on a specific plot and disappears when you hover away from it
